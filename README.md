# EcoScore: AI-Powered Sustainable Shopping Platform

Online shoppers lack easy access to environmental impact information when making purchase decisions, making it difficult to make eco-conscious choices. Consumers and businesses are increasingly aware of the importance of sustainability, but they often lack the tools to make informed eco-friendly purchasing decisions.
